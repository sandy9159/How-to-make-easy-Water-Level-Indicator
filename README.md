How to make a water level indicator to save water from overflowing with Motor Dry run prevention.

A water level indicator is used to show the level of water in an over head tank. This keeps the user informed about the water level at all times and avoids the situation of water running out when it is most needed.

There are many videos on youtube But this one is unique because this water level indicator circuit also has an water flow signal.

It not only indicates the amount of water present in the overhead tank but also gives the water inlet signal so that dry run can be prevented.



## COMPONENT REQUIRED

> 1. Transistor BC547 -- 6 no's

> 5. Resistor 10k ohm - 6 no's

> 6. LCD back light LED (can use normal LED also)- 1 no

> 7. Small PCB

> 8. 9V Battery with Clip - 1 no

> 9. Female connector - 1 no

> 10.Some Wires.


Basically the unit is made up of various sensors acting as a switch. Let me explain in a simple way. What happens is when you turn on you water pump, the water starts to get pumped from your underground reservoir  or from your underground water supply from the pipes to your water tank. In the tank there is a set of sensors( to be precise there are 7 sensors), in the water tank. Just think them as a switch, 

as the work of the sensor will be to connect a circuit. I will explain in details in my instructables. So the water starts to get filled in the tank and when the water level in the tank starts to rise up, what happens is that the sensors that is installed in the tank 

starts to get activated one by one indicating the water level in the tank. And finally when it reaches to its top most sensor, there will be a visual display as well as a sound from the unit indicating that the water has filled in the tank and one can be alerted that the tank has been filled up and the water pump has to be switched off saving the electricity bill as well as over flow of water from the tank.
